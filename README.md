NinjaGame
=========

#Description

The game will involve controlling your character by having them jump from wall to wall. When
the user clicks, the character will jump in the direction of the click. The user can click
a second time to change the character's direction midair. The current idea is to have the
character be a ninja. The ninja's first jump will include a sword attack, and their midair
direction change will include a kicking attack. The game will have targets that require
different attacks to hit. The goal will be to get every target that appears.
